      story: In Havana, Hemingway liked to have his Daiquiris at La Floridita and
        his Mojitos at La Bodeguita del Medio. Although La Bodeguita is credited with
        popularizing the Mojito, there's a lot of controversy about the drink's origin.
        Some believe Constante Ribailagua of the Floridita made the first Mojito.
        The Mint Julep made in the southern United States beginning in the late eighteenth
        century from brandy, peach brandy, and eventually from bourbon was one of
        the first American cocktails to get international recognition, and some believe
        it sparked the creation of the rum version called Mojito in Cuba. The Mojito
        was a farmer's drink, sort of the Budweiser of Cuba, with its origins sometime
        between 1850, when the rum industry in Cuba modernized, in 1920. Those years
        brought important elements of the drink to Cuba for the first time, like ice
        and charged water. (The first shipments of ice arrived from New England in
        the 1850s, but you can bet only the wealthy had access until the turn of the
        century, when the first artificial ice plants began operation in Cuba.) A
        spicy sauce of the same name is used in the islands to marinate meat, but
        it seems to be unrelated to the drink.
