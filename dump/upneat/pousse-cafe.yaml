      story: There is a section in Jerry Thomas's 1862 edition of How to Mix Drinks
        called "Fancy Drinks" that begins with three Pousse Café recipes. The first
        is from an early-nineteenth-century saloon owner from New Orleans named Joseph
        Santina, whom Thomas credits with improving the whole category of cocktail
        with his Crustas. Santina's Pousse Café is made with Cognac, maraschino, and
        curaçao. Thomas's instructions say to "mix well"
