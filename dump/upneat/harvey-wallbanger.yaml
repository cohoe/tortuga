      story: "This 1960s drink is purportedly named after a surfer who drank so much\
        \ he'd bump into the walls. My all-knowing friend Brian Rea tells me that\
        \ the reason the surfer drank so many Wallbangers was to get the empty Galliano\
        \ bottles: women really loved them."
