      story: This is Harry Johnson's Martini recipe from his 1888 Bartender's Manual.
        Johnson and Jerry Thomas were the reigning kings of the original cocktail
        era, 1850 through 1900. Johnson always believed he held the upper hand, claiming
        to have published a bar-recipe book prior to Thomas's 1862 volume. If this
        is true, no copy has ever turned up in my research. Johnson did win the first
        bartender competition in the history of the modern profession, in New Orleans
        in 1869, against Ive top contenders. Unfortunately, Thomas wasn't part of
        the competition, so the debate over who really was the greatest will never
        be settled.
