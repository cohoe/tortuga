      story: JOAQUÍN SIMÓ, 2009 In the 1980s, Julio Bermejo, an owner of Tommy's Mexican
        Restaurant in San Francisco, popularized a margarita sweetened with agave
        syrup. We've used his spec for some fun spin-offs, including this version
        made with lemon juice and orange marmalade.
