    origin:
      year: 1921
      story: In about 1921, the cocktail muse inspired the great Constantino Ribalaigua
        Vert of the El Floridita Bar in Havana when he added fresh grapefruit juice
        and maraschino liqueur to the Daiquiri. The result is ambrosia. The drink
        was made as a frozen drink at the famous Floridita and was named Papa Doble,
        or "Papa's Double," after Ernest Hemingway. The original recipe didn't call
        for any sugar, just a touch of the maraschino liqueur, and it is always reprinted
        that way out of respect to Papa; Hemingway had an aversion to sugar. But you
        can be sure that for the average customer at the Floridita, the Simple Syrup
        was part of the recipe.
