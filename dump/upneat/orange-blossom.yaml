    origin:
      story: 'One of my favorite cocktail authors, David A. Embury, refers to this
        cocktail as the spawn of the Prohibition toad. But he does reluctantly offer
        his recipe: 2 parts gin to 1 part orange to .5 part Simple Syrup. Modern tastes
        lean toward a lighter drink, so I altered the recipe and added Cointreau instead
        of Simple Syrup to bring a bit of flavor along with sweetness.'
