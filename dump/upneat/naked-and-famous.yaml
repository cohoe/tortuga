      story: JOAQUÍN SIMÓ, 2011 This cocktail is the bastard child born out of an
        illicit Oaxacan love affair between the classic Last Word and the Paper Plane,
        a drink Sam Ross created at the West Village bar Little Branch. Choosing an
        aggressively smoky, funky mezcal was key here, as there is relatively little
        of it in the drink and it needs to stand up against two liqueurs, neither
        of which lacks complexity.
