      story: In his 1862 How To Mix Drinks, Jerry Thomas lists toddies and slings
        together. He indicates that the only difference between them is a little grated
        nutmeg on top of a sling. Thomas served toddies and slings hot and cold and
        used only spirits, sugar, and water (except for the Apple Toddy, which is
        made with a baked apple). By the 1890s, lemon juice and lemon peel were introduced
        to the toddy and it was on its way to becoming a lemon-and-honey hot cure
        for colds, dispensed by mothers and grandmothers everywhere.
