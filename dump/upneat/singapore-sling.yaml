    origin:
      year: 1915
      story: Created at the Long Bar in the Raffes Hotel in Singapore about 1915 by
        bartender Ngiam Tong Boon. The recipe varies from book to book. Robin Kelly
        O'Connor, the Bordeaux wine expert, faxed me this recipe from Raffles while
        staying there in 1990. I've never tasted a better version.
