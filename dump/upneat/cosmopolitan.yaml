      year: 1980
      story: "The contemporary recipe for the Cosmopolitan goes back to the test-marketing\
        \ of Absolut Citron. I've heard an unsubstantiated rumor that a woman named\
        \ Cheryl Cook invented it in South Beach, Miami, though I was given credit\
        \ for inventing it by New York magazine (and other publications that cited\
        \ the New York article as a source). Well, I didn't. What I did do was popularize\
        \ a definitive recipe that became widely accepted as the standard. The drink\
        \ )rst appeared on menus in the late 1980s, )rst in New York City at the Odeon\
        \ in TriBeCa, and )rst in San Francisco at the Fog City Diner; of course,\
        \ both locations claim to have invented the drink. I put it on my menu at\
        \ the Rainbow Room in 1996. Shortly after that, Madonna was spotted drinking\
        \ one, and overnight I was getting calls from as far away as Germany and Australia\
        \ for the recipe. I added the additional touches of Cointreau and the 5amed\
        \ orange peel for garnish and presented it several times on television around\
        \ the country. Now, it is certainly the most recognized drink in the world,\
        \ next to the classic Martini. But to go back even further: Ocean Spray Cranberry\
        \ Juice has promoted spirits with their products aggressively for years, and\
        \ from 1956 to 1970 they were featuring a series of cocktails, one of which\
        \ was made with 1 ounce of vodka, 1 ounce of cranberry juice, and a squeeze\
        \ of  lime, called the Harpoon. Add some Triple Sec or Cointreau and you have\
        \ a Cosmopolitan."
