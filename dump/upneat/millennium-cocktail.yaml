      story: "I was commissioned to create a cocktail with the Millennium bottling\
        \ from Courvoisier and it turned out better than I ever expected. But now\
        \ I guess I need to change the name: It's too good to be relegated to the\
        \ trash heap of millennium merchandise. But in the couple of years since I\
        \ thought I invented the drink, I acquired an out-of-print book called The\
        \ Roving Bartender, by Bill Kelly (1946). Much to my surprise, it includes\
        \ a drink called the East India Cocktail with brandy, cura√ßao, pineapple,\
        \ and bitters. I don't know if it was Bill's original or if it predates his\
        \ book. My version has a couple of subtle additions that translate to a lot\
        \ of additional Ravor"
