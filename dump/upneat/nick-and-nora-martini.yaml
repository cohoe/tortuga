    origin:
      story: 'During Prohibition, the gin tasted so bad that everything imaginable
        was added to it to mask the Ravor. The martini waned in popularity. After
        Prohibition, Nick and Nora Charles of the Thin Man movies and President Franklin
        Roosevelt put the Martini back on the map. Good gin was back, and people once
        more embraced the simplicity of the Martini. America got wetter and the Martini
        got drier: The Nick and Nora recipe calls for 3 parts gin to 1 part dry vermouth.
        This ratio reigned through the thirties and forties.'
