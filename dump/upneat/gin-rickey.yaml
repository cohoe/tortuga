    origin:
      year: 1900
      story: Rickeys are traditionally a dry drink, but syrup or sugar can be added.
        the Rickey took its name from "Colonel Joe" Rickey, a lobbyist in Washington
        in the late nineteenth century who regularly drank with members of Congress
        in shoemaker's bar. The barman who invented the drink let Colonel Joe taste
        it, and when the colonel called for another, he christened it the Gin Rickey.
        Oddly enough, Colonel Joe later became the first major importer of limes to
        this country. The early recipe, which first appeared in Modern Mixed Drinks,
        by George Kappeler, in 1900, is exactly the same as our contemporary recipe.
        The Gin Rickey is a jumping-off point for more of-the-moment, sexy cocktails.
