    origin:
      story: John Martin used this drink to promote his new product, Smirnoff Vodka,
        after the Second World War. He did promotions with the owner of the Cock and
        Bull, a big star hangout on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. It was served
        in a copper mug engraved with two mules kicking up their heels. Many of the
        stars had mugs with their names inscribed hanging over the bar. Smirnoff thus
        became the first real commercial brand of vodka in this country, built on
        Hollywood star power.
