    origin:
      year: 1862
      story: The Japanese Cocktail was one of the very few cocktails listed in Jerry
        Thomas's 1862 edition of How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivants Companion. He
        calls for stirring with a couple of peels of lemon in the bar glass. Later
        recipes took the citrus note a bit farther by actually adding lime juice.
        I don't think limes were as available as lemons in 1862, or perhaps Jerry
        would have used them as well.
