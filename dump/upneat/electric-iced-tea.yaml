    origin:
      story: Credit for this incredibly successful frat-house drink is attributed
        to Robert C. Butt. When made properly, the drink tastes great and doesn't
        have to be an evening ender. The key is to have all the spirits present but
        in small amounts. In the recipe here, the total alcohol content is 2.5 ounces.
        It is a well-balanced, good-tasting drink, in large part because of the fresh
        lemon juice and simple syrup. Besides the "Long Island" version, there are
        a few other regional variations.
