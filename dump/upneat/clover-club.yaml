    origin:
      year: 1931
      story: In his Old Waldorf Bar Days (1931), Albert Stevens Crockett credits this
        pre-Prohibition cocktail to the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia,
        where an Algonquin Round Table sort of group called the Clover Club lent its
        name to the drink. When raspberries are in season, omit the raspberry syrup
        and instead muddle 6  raspberries in the shaker with the Simple Syrup, then
        add the rest of the ingredients, shake, and strain. Drinks with egg must be
        shaken harder and longer to emulsify the egg.
