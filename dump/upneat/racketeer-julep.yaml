    instructions:
    - text: Rub the mint around the inside of a julep tin and discard
    - text: Put the remaining ingredients (except the bitters) in the tin
    - text: Fill the tin halfway with crushed ice
    - text: Stir with a teaspoon, churning the ice as you go, for about 10 seconds,
        holding the tin by the rim so the entire tin can eventually frost up

        tin is completely frosted
    - text: Add more ice to form a cone above the rim
    - text: Top with the bitters
