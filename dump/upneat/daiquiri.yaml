    origin:
      story: This Cuban classic gets its name from the town of the same name in the
        Oriente province. The recipe was created by an American mining engineer named
        Jennings Cox and a Cuban engineer named Pagliuchi in the late nineteenth century.
        The talented barmen in Havana, especially Constantino Ribalaigua Vert, further
        refined it. The Daiquiri made its first appearance in the United States at
        the Army Navy Club in Washington, D.C., taken there from Cuba by Admiral Lucius
        Johnson. Today you can have a Daiquiri in the Army Navy Club's Daiquiri Lounge.
        Below is the original recipe; for Constante's special Papa Doble, see the
        Hemingway Daiquiri.
