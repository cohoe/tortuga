      story: One of the problems for night owls like me is finding the time to socialize
        with regular folks during nonworking hours. One evening in 1995, I was mulling
        over this dilemma with my good friend Carl Butrum, and we decided the only
        solution was a party that would last all night, so that people could arrive
        at any time from six in the evening to six in the morning. The party would
        be dubbed "Straight on 'til Morning" and should be an annual event. When I
        decided that I would create a special cocktail to celebrate the first "Straight
        on 'til Morning" party, Sharen Butrum requested that whatever it tasted like,
        the drink should be pink. This was because her living room was pink. And she
        thought pink would be festive. At least it gave me my creative direction.
        Pink called for fresh strawberries and strawberry liqueur. The resulting creation,
        named the "209 East," after their house on Forty-eighth Street, was such a
        hit that not only is it traditionally served at every "Straight on 'til Morning"
        party, but it became a featured item on the cocktail list at the Rainbow Room.
