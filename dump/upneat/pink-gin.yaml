    origin:
      story: 'One of the classic drinks I used to serve at the Hotel Bel-Air was Pink
        Gin, which called for orange bitters. After going through two or three bottles
        of DeKuyper Orange Bitters, I spoke to the steward about ordering more. He
        informed me that it was no longer produced, and had not been available for
        over twenty years. There are now a few compatible products available: The
        Fee Brothers in Rochester, New York, produce an orange bitters, but it lacks
        the flavor and punch of the original. A better one is produced in Europe by
        the Bols Company, but sadly it is not available here.'
