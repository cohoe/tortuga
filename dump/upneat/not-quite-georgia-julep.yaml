    instructions:
    - text: Put all the ingredients in a julep tin
    - text: Fill the tin halfway with crushed ice
    - text: Stir with a teaspoon, churning the ice as you go, for about 10 seconds,
        holding the tin by the rim so the entire tin can eventually frost up
    - text: Add more crushed ice to fill the tin two-thirds full and stir until the
        tin is completely frosted
    - text: Add more ice to form a cone above the rim
