      story: Gary and Mardee Regan have supplied me for a couple of years now with
        orange bitters prepared from a recipe that appeared in the 1862 first edition
        of Jerry Thomas's How to Mix Drinks. Gary and Mardee also spend plenty of
        time in their bar/laboratory creating recipes of their own. This is their
        recipe.
