      story: This is basically lemonade, but with the interesting addition of red
        wine instead of water. Harry Johnson in his book Bartender Manual, 1898, called
        it Claret Lemonade and prepared it by filling a tumbler with crushed ice,
        filling it three-fourths full with lemonade, and floating the claret on top.
