      story: I adapted this recipe from the White Plush, a drink of whiskey and milk,
        in How to Mix Drinks by Jerry Thomas (1862). The White Plush was named after
        a gullible New England buyer, as Thomas tells it, who was hustled by a couple
        of dry-goods salesmen in New York City. They convinced him he was drinking
        milk and seltzer, a popular local favorite. When the whiskey started to take
        hold, he knocked over his "milk" and stared at it a moment, then remarked,
        "Gee, it looks just like white plush." This prompted the two slicks to order
        "another yard of white plush for the gentleman" from the knowing bartender.
