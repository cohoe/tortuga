    origin:
      story: This cocktail was named after Harry Dwoskin, who into his nineties would
        throw an elaborate birthday party for himself each year. Harry was fastidious
        with his money and claimed he had enough to cover the parties through his
        104th birthday. I created this drink for his ninetieth at the Rainbow Room.
        He liked it so much that he served it at every birthday party until his last
        one at age ninety-six.
