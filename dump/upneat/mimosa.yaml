    origin:
      story: This drink was also known as a Bucks Fizz. Frank Meier of the Ritz Bar
        in Paris had an alternate recipe called the Valencia, with orange juice, apricot
        liqueur, and Champagne. (Valencia is also a Martini variation, with fino sherry
        in place of the vermouth.) A float of Cointreau is an appealing extra for
        a special drink.
