      story: One day Joe came in with Gerard Pangaud, who announced that he had just
        won the Margarita contest in Paris and challenged me to make one. They began
        to sip several versions of my Margarita, trying to determine the perfect proportions
        of lime juice, Cointreau, and Cuervo Gold down to the milliliter. While they
        were drinking all those Margaritas, I tried to cut them oM because Joe was
        getting drunk. But he just snarled at me that he owned the joint and ordered
        another one
