    origin:
      year: 1944
      story: The Mai Tai was created in 1944 by Victor Bergeron at his famed bar Trader
        Vic's in Emeryville, California, to take advantage of some good sixteen-year-old
        Jamaican rum he had around. Victor often said it was one of the finest drinks
        he'd ever concocted. When he made the drink the first time, he served it to
        his friends from Tahiti, Ham and Carrie Guild. After tasting the drink, Carrie
        raised her glass and said, "Mai tai roa ae," which means "out of this world"
        or "the best" in Tahitian. "That's the name of the drink," replied Bergeron.
        This is another sour-formula drink, and in this case the sweet ingredients
        are orange cura√ßao and orgeat or orzata syrup. Don't over-use the strong flavor
        of orgeat, which should be subtle.
