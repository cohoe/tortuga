    origin:
      story: Constantino (Constante) Ribalaigua Vert at the El Floridita Bar in Havana,
        Cuba, created the original frozen Daiquiri. I adapted Constante's recipe to
        accommodate today's larger glassware and to sweeten it slightly. Constante
        added the juice of the Marsh grapefruit, a very sweet seedless variety from
        the Isle of Pines near Havana, as well as maraschino liqueur to provide a
        delicate floral note.
