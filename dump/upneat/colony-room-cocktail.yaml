      story: "The Colony Room Club in London is known for many things, but cocktails\
        \ is not one of them. As longtime member Roddy Ashworth once put it: \"If\
        \ a member asks for a PiÃ±a Colada, he is likely to be served with little\
        \ more than raised eyebrows and a large vodka and tonic.\" In 1995, while\
        \ visiting London to judge a bartending contest, I ended up at the Colony\
        \ Room, where I was surprised to discover that the most complex cocktail available\
        \ was a screwdriver (although to get one, I had to ask for a large vodka and\
        \ orange). Faced with the prospect of drinking vodka and orange all night,\
        \ I convinced proprietor Michael Wojas to allow me to get behind the bar and\
        \ fashion my own special mix. The available ingredients were limited, but\
        \ I did manage to invent a drink worthy of the club's name. Here's the recipe."
