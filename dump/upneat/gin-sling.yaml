    origin:
      story: This is a late-nineteenth-century sling recipe that I served for years
        at the Rainbow Room with great success. The ladies from the photo-editing
        department of the Associated Press next door were especially fond of this
        recipe. The cocktail was first described in print as a bittered sling. Before
        the addition of bitters, a sling was spirits, sugar water, and sometimes lemon.
