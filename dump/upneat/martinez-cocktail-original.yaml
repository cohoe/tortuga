      year: 1890
      story: "Like all royalty, the king of cocktails has lineage. the British claim\
        \ the Martini was named after a late-nineteenth-century firearm of the same\
        \ name, famous for its kick. The Martini & Rossi vermouth company takes credit\
        \ for its name, since vermouth is the defining ingredient in the Martini,\
        \ and they did market a bottled dry martini around the world in the 1890s.\
        \ Martini di Arma di Taggia, the principal bartender at the Knickerbocker\
        \ Hotel in New York City at the turn of the century, is also given credit\
        \ for the Martini. Mr. Di Taggia played an important role in the evolution\
        \ of the drink when he married dry gin with dry vermouth (and orange bitters)\
        \ for the first time, but there is more to the story. There was a cocktail\
        \ in the 1850s called the Fancy Gin Cocktail (opposite) that paired Old Tom\
        \ Gin and orange curaçao. At the time the Fancy Gin became popular, Martini\
        \ & Rossi Vermouth was not readily available in this country, the Martini\
        \ and Henry riRe was still on the drawing board, and Martini di Arma di Taggia\
        \ was just a small boy. When vermouth became widely available by the 1870s,\
        \ the use of curaçao as a sweetener in cocktails waned, and vermouth became\
        \ the sweetener of choice, used in almost the same applications married with\
        \ a base liquor and bitters. Vermouth wasn't even produced commercially until\
        \ the late eighteenth century in Europe, and it was a relatively new product\
        \ for the United States; the first shipments arrived in the 1850s. In his\
        \ 1887 Bartender's Guide, Jerry Thomas refers to vermouth several times without\
        \ designating Italian or French (sweet or dry). This wasn't an omission: French\
        \ vermouth didn't become widely available until the late 1890s."
