    origin:
      story: "During World War I, Captain Harry S Truman once told his men, just minutes\
        \ before their French 75 guns rattled 75- millimeter shells at the Germans\
        \ (at a rate of 30 rounds per minute): \"I'd rather be right here than be\
        \ president of the United States!\" This drink is named after that French\
        \ artillery piece. The recipe originally called for gin, but it became more\
        \ popular using brandy."
