      story: If edible flowers are not available, garnish this drink with fresh mint
        and lemon piece. I did a series of summer drinks for Absolut Vodka garnished
        with edible flowers. This is one example. For information on edible flowers,
        see Lucinda Hutson's book Herb Garden Cookbook (1998).
