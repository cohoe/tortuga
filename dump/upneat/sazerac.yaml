    origin:
      year: 1859
      story: This drink is based on a bitters created by Antoine Amédée Peychaud,
        who made a Cognac cocktail by mixing his bitters with Cognac. The most popular
        Cognac for many years in New Orleans was Sazerac de Forge et Fils. In 1859,
        John Schiller officially christened the Sazerac Cocktail in his newly opened
        bar, the Sazerac Coffee House. When John H. Handy took over the bar, he altered
        the famous drink and used whiskey instead of Cognac. I have my own twist on
        the Sazerac, a mix of Cognac and bourbon.
