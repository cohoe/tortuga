      story: This cocktail also has a direct line to the Martinez cocktail, minus
        the bitters and maraschino. The Gin and It was actually ordered in the HoSman
        House and other New York bars of the 1880s and '90s, simply as a Sweet Martini,
        and later as a Gin and Italian. During Prohibition, Gin and Italian was shortened
        to Gin & It.
