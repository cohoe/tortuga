    origin:
      story: About twenty years ago, when I was working at the bar at the Hotel Bel-Air,
        I had just finished making a Sidecar one afternoon when an older gentleman
        looked at me and said, "You know what a real Sidecar is, son?" I thought I
        did until I heard him describe the recipe. After four years of tending bar,
        I finally began to collect proper recipes.
