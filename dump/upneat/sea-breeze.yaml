      story: The Sea Breeze was created as a promotion by Ocean Spray Company in the
        sixties to take advantage of the growing popularity of vodka. They even participated
        in the release of a new spirit product called Tropico (not to be confused
        with today's Bacardi Tropico) that was a blend of Don Cossack vodka and cranberry
        juice. The Seagram Company used the Sea Breeze to promote its aged Ancient
        Golden Gin in the 1960s and set the stage for the tremendous popularity of
        the Cosmopolitan.
