      story: Those long Jamaican swizzles are hard to come by, but there is a solution.
        Go to the housewares store and buy a wooden spoon with a hole in the bowl
        of the spoon and a long handle. Put it between the palms of your hand and
        swizzle away. For a flavor twist, try using flavored syrups like Simple Syrup
        with vanilla beans or orgeat.
