      year: 1906
      story: "The modern-style martini of London Dry gin with dry vermouth wasn't\
        \ offered until the turn of the century. I call it the Knickerbocker Martini.\
        \ Colonel John Jacob Astor's Knickerbocker Hotel, built in in 1906, housed\
        \ one of the grandest bars in New York. The bar was also the original home\
        \ of the Maxfield Parrish triptych of Old King Cole that now hangs above the\
        \ bar at the St. Regis Hotel. The principal bartender, Martini di Arma di\
        \ Taggia, made his famous \"dry\" martini there. And although his recipe of\
        \ equal parts of dry gin and dry vermouth was a long way off from our modern\
        \ dry Martini, it was the first combination of dry vermouth and dry gin. He\
        \ mixed half Plymouth gin and half-dry or French vermouth with a dash of orange\
        \ bitters. Sweet Martinis were also still very popular, and eventually they\
        \ evolved into the Gin and Italian, or Gin and It as the drink was called\
        \ during Prohibition. Here is a recipe for a \"dry\" martini similar to the\
        \ Knickerbocker Martini, from Louis Muckensturm's Louis Mixed Drinks (1906).\
        \ Notice that Muckensturm's version calls for 2 to 1 gin to vermouth, a step\
        \ forward: but he had that dash of cura√ßao to cater to America's sweet tooth."
