      story: "In the 1950s in Puerto Rico, a man named Don Ram칩n Lopez- Irizarry came\
        \ up with a delicious homogenized cream made from coconut. The product became\
        \ known as Coco Lopez cream of coconut, and it was used for tropical dishes\
        \ and desserts. But the best was yet to come: In 1957 Ram칩n Marrero, a bartender\
        \ at Puerto Rico's Caribe Hilton, combined coconut cream with rum, pineapple\
        \ juice, and ice in a blender to create this famous drink. Victor Bergeron\
        \ (Trader Vic) borrowed Marrero's recipe in his later cocktail books and called\
        \ it the Bahia. The trick to making a great Pi침a Colada is to use both light\
        \ rum and dark rum, a dash of bitters, and a little heavy cream, which creates\
        \ a drink with a much more complex flavor."
