      story: JOAQUÍN SIMÓ, 2009 This is the opposite of a pisco sour. Instead of shaking
        the drink with citrus and egg whites, which can blanket the flavors of pisco,
        I showcased its fruit and floral notes by stirring it with vermouth and Cocchi
        Americano, an aperitif flavored with cinchona bark and orange.
