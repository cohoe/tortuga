    origin:
      story: Created for Zoe's restaurant in SoHo in Manhattan. I never mixed vodkas
        together in a drink as I have done with rums for years until all the flavored
        vodkas arrived. Now I'm finding some wonderful combinations using flavored
        vodkas together in the same drink or paired with regular vodka.
