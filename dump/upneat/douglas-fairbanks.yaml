    origin:
      story: Drinks like this one from the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries
        that call for egg, egg white, or egg yolk are tricky. The eggs were smaller
        than our small eggs are today. Following the old recipe instructions that
        call for a whole egg or the white of an egg with the size of today's eggs
        will throw the drink out of whack. The solution is to beat the whole egg or
        the whites and to emulsify it to a liquid form and then measure. In old recipes
        that call for a whole egg, I use .75 ounce of a small egg.
