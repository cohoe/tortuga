    origin:
      story: Coca-Cola was only available in bottles for four years when the Rough
        Riders brought it along with them to Cuba. They mixed it with Cuban rum and
        lime and named it after their battle cry, "Cuba Libre." "Free Cuba" was the
        cry heard from the Rough Riders and their Cuban counterparts as they swept
        the Spanish out of Cuba.
