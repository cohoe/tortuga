      story: "The Old Fashioned was created at the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky.\
        \ There are two warring camps of Old Fashioned drinkers: those who muddle\
        \ the fruit and those who don't. I belong to the first camp, as the muddling\
        \ adds so much flavor. Those other guys just want some sweetened whiskey,\
        \ not an Old Fashioned. The 1862 Whiskey Cobbler"
