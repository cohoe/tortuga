    origin:
      story: Passoa is a passion-fruit liqueur from the French, who love the flavor
        and make wonderful liqueurs with it. Passoa is a terrific mixer, especially
        in rum drinks, but it will mix with many different spirits. Try to find special
        ceramic pineapple glasses to serve this, or if you're really ambitious, go
        to the gourmet grocery and get miniature pineapples, hollow them out, and
        serve in them. Be very careful when scraping out the fruit that you don't
        puncture the skin.
