      story: In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Cold War got colder and the Martini
        got stronger, with barely a hint of vermouth. John Martin succeeded in putting
        his Smirnoff Vodka bottle in front of all the right people, and vodka actually
        passed gin as the white spirit of choice.
