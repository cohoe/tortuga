    origin:
      story: In the French islands in the Caribbean, plantation owners would make
        their own punch from local rum, citrus fruits, and homemade sugar syrup. They
        called it Petite Punch, or Ti-punk, when shortened. This is the house drink
        all over the French West Indies. It is simple and fun, and you can play with
        the recipe. The basic ingredients are local rum, sugar syrup, and lime juice,
        but the variations are plentiful. Use your favorite rum, and use sugar syrup
        or spiced sugar syrup.
