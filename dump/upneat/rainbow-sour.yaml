    origin:
      story: Pineau des Charentes has a wonderful bit of lore surrounding it. It is
        a mistelle, a combination of raw grape juice and some form of spirit; in the
        case of the Pineau des Charentes, the spirit is Cognac. The story is that
        a Cognac producer thought he was blending two Cognacs when he topped up a
        barrel in his cellar, but one of the barrels contained raw grape juice. He
        was sure he had destroyed a batch of good Cognac and put it aside and left
        it. A couple of years later, his cellar-master tasted it while checking barrels,
        and it had matured in an interesting way. The maker bottled it under the name
        Pineau des Charentes and a new product was born. Today several Cognac producers
        bottle a Pineau, perhaps using Cognac that is not suited for blending into
        their regular stocks. Pineau des Charentes is also known as Angelica.
