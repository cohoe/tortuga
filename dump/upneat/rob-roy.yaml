      story: "Bill Grimes, in his wonderful book Straight Up or On the Rocks, reveals\
        \ the origin of the name of this scotch Manhattan: a Broadway show called\
        \ Rob Roy. In the original The Savoy Cocktail Book (1930), Harry Craddock\
        \ calls for equal parts of scotch, sweet vermouth, and dry vermouth, but that\
        \ might be a tad sweet for today's drinker. This is also called Affinity."
