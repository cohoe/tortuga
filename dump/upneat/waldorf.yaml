      story: Albert Stevens Crockett's Old Waldorf Bar Days (1931) calls for equal
        parts of absinthe, sweet vermouth, and whiskey. That might have been fine
        with true absinthe, which was unsweetened and very bitter, but it won't work
        with today's absinthe substitutes. This recipe is much more appealing.
