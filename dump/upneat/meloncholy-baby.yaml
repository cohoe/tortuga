    origin:
      story: 'One of my most memorable experiences as a bartender was in the Rainbow
        Room: I created a special drink, on the spot, for a woman who had just ended
        a love affair and was really, really down in the dumps. It had flaming lemon
        peels and ended up becoming the drink of the night.'
