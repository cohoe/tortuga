      story: JOAQUÍN SIMÓ, 2009 Apricots are such a frustrating fresh fruit to work
        with because they're so inconsistent. You can buy a dozen of them and have
        two that are perfect beyond belief, three that are almost delicious, and seven
        others that are a mealy bunch of nothing. That's why I use a good apricot
        liqueur in this drink instead of fresh fruit. I was after a light-bodied cocktail
        that shone forth with fruit and nuts yet remained dry and refreshing.
