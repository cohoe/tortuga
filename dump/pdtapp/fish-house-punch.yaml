    - text: The original recipe called for peach brandy, a peach eau de vie aged in
        wood barrels that was absent from the market when we resurrected this recipe.
        In the years since, Peach Street Distillers has released the first new bottling
        of peach brandy in over a centuryand it’s a gem!
