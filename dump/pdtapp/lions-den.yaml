    - text: Jeff accented the spicy quality of the tequila though the addition of
        shishito pepper, whose Japanese name originates from the pepper’s resemblance
        to a lion's head. Note that PDT doesn’t muddle the pepperthey just shake it
        up with Kold Draft ice cubes. Depending on your shaking technique, you may
        wish to give it a little muddle, beforehand.
