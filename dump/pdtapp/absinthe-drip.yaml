    - text: The water in this classic preparation for traditional absinthe helps release
        the aromatic elements of the spirit and dilutes it to a potable strength.

    instructions:
    - text: Pour absinthe into a chilled absinthe glass. Place a slotted absinthe
        spoon over the rim of the glass and set a sugar cube on top of the spoon.
        Using an absinthe fountain or water carafe, slowly pour or drip ice-cold water
        over the sugar cube into the glass. As the dripping water dissolves the sugar
        cube, watch the “hydrophobic” layer of undiluted absinthe rise to the top
        of the glass. When the mixture is completely cloudy, the drip should be ready.
        Stir and serve.
