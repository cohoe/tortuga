            In a wineglass, combine the mezcal, tequila, Averna, and curacao and swirl
            together. Using an atomizer or an olive oil mister, mist 3 small pumps of
            bitters on the insides of the glass above the cocktail. Garnish with a
            flamed orange zest, rested on the rim of the wineglass.
      garnish:
        - slug: orange twist

            Another scaffa. Very agave heavy. I almost would prefer the chilling
            effect of the Oaxaca Old Fashioned rather than room-temperature. I
            also used Astral rather than Siete Leguas and the Pierre Ferrand
            dry curacao. Wonder if full sweet orange would work better.
