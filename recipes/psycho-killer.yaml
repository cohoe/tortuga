            Orange twist came from the blog, not in the book. All others
            as spec except for absinthe and cacao brands. Amazingly this
            works out really well. I think it'd be better over ice like
            a true Negroni. This has an interesting bittersweet character
            without being overly forward on anything.

            I definitely prefer this as a negroni style over ice, with an
            extra dash of absinthe.
