            fine mesh strainer into a double old fashioned glass over one large ice cube.

            The end result is a wonderful old fashioned with a scotch/rum base and 
            thoughtful blend of sherry utilizing mint to bolster the aromatics. A lot of 
            rum old fashioneds play up the classic rum+cigar combo so it's quite 
            refreshing (literally) to not have any of that going on here. I also find the 
            use of a solera-aged scotch to be quite appropriate for a sherry drink.
