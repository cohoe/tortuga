      This is a variation of a recipe [Jamie Boudreau] had submitted to Jim Meehan of PDT
      fame for Food & Wine's annual cocktail book. He took my recipe, added Dubonnet, and
      changed the name, which, quite frankly, makde the cocktail better.

            Did with Old Overholt. Rather light and dry. Not quite my style but a good balanced
            drink. The Rittenhouse that Meehan uses may give a bit more oomph.
