      This 2005 cocktail from New York cocktail icon Audrey Saunders is
      true to its name, with a combination of classic Italian and American
      ingredients: spicy American rye mixed with the vegetal, bittersweet Cynar
      and sweet, herbal Italian vermouth. This variation on the classic
      Manhattan has become the constant drink I order when I'm looking for
      something brown, bitter, and stirred at the end of the night. A little
      splash of cherry syrup in the mixing glass would also be welcome.

            Given this drinks cherry presence I figured the Cleveland Whiskey
            rye with black cherry wood would be a solid fit to use. However the
            note about spicy rye takes precedence. This comes out way better with
            some Rittenhouse 100 Rye. I believe it does trend towards the suggestion
            of an end-of-night drink thats basically a modifie Negroni. Has an
            almost chocolate-like quality to it. This comment comes after a few in
            so a grain of salt is required.
