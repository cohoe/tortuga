      This drink is inspired by the Chicago Cocktail from the iconic New
      York speakeasy Milk & Honey, which is essentially a rum Manhattan.
      The splash of champagne acts more like a garnish, lightening up the
      drink a little bit.

      notes:
        - i agree with the assessment of a rum manhattan
        - this may go better over a large ice cube rather than a coupe
