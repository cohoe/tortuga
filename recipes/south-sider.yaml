      This drink is inspired by the Chicago Cocktail from the iconic New
      York speakeasy Milk & Honey, which is essentially a rum Manhattan.
      The splash of champagne acts more like a garnish, lightening up the
      drink a little bit.

        - text: this may go better over a large ice cube rather than a coupe
