            This is quite nice. Probably better with a lemon twist versus my orange. Nice
            balance, not watered down like the other spec.

            I dont know when I made that comment because I had the wrong ingredient in here
            for a long time. Had dry, is actually blanc. The dry version isnt bad and actually
            gets some interesting apple-y vibes. Did a blend of Dead Rabbit, Writers Tears, and
            GrandTen. I think I would like this more if it was the blanc but its actually not bad
            with the dry.
