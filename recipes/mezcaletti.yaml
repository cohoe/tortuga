            Not bad. Lemon peel definitely important here. Did with Chichicapa
            so might be a bit hotter on the mezcal side. Has a nice balance to things
            with the Meletti. Simpler to make than a Oaxaca Old Fashioned but with
            some similar characteristics.

            With Casamigos, it's not quite as potent. I feel its actually missing something
            there. Definitely a hotter mezcal is recommended.
