      were a year late, big deal) of Columbus’ “discovery” of America.

            Carefully peel the lemons and oranges, getting as little of the white
            pith as you can. Muddle the peels with the sugar until you’ve extracted
            as much citrus oil as you can from them, and allow to sit for at least
            an hour, preferably three hours. Juice the fruit and strain the juice.

            Combine the boozes, juices and tea with the muddled peels and sugar in
            a large punch bowl and stir until dissolved. Remove the peels. Add the
            Champagne and stir, then add a large block of ice to keep chilled. Ladle
            into small punch glasses and allow your guests to serve themselves until
            it’s gone (and I guarantee you’ll have none left).

            evening in 2022. Sounded interesting.
