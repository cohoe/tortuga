      This cocktail is inspired by 'Boss Tom' Pendergast, the businessman who 'ran'
      Kansas City during Prohibition, and kept things swinging. He's largely credited
      with making KC the biggest party town in the country during that time, which
      led to the rise of it as a Jazz town and to the invention of bebop.

            A very interesting citrus twang on a whiskey stirred drink. I rather
            like this. Could benefit from super-enhanced chilling. Has a lot of
            richness. Did with house sweet vermouth.
