            Rinse a chilled glass with absinthe and set aside. Combine the
            remaining ingredients in a mixing glass over ice and stir until
            chilled. Strain into the prepared glass. Garnish with an
            expressed lemon peel held 4 to 6 inches over the surface of the
            drink.

            Oh yeah, this works. Don't have much experience to compare it
            to but despite the peychauds and absinthe it's not overly
            anise-y.
