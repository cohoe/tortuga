      notes:
        - text: my 3:2 honey syrup is almost a year old, so that is likely having an impact. at first i thought 
            this was weird, but it totally works. the abrasiveness of both spirits is balanced out with the
            banana. not overly sweet at all. I agree with the assessment in the book that this would do better
            in a snifter where the aromas can be blasted in your face.
