            Build all ingredients in an Old Fashioned glass. Add ice and stir
            gently to combine. Express a large grapefruit twist over the
            drink and place in the glass.

            This is quite good. I once did it with .5oz of the S&C and
            it totally threw everything off. Haven't tried with my new
            Diplomatico since it seems they rebranded recently.
