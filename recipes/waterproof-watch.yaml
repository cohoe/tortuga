            The Aperol seems to take a front stage here. Wonder if I might like
            Plymouth here more. Starts off OK but I definitely prefer the Coral
            Reef in this style of drink. The Montenegro seems to get lost. This
            might be one of the most neutral drinks I've ever had. Not bitter
            but not sweet. Good gateway with time in the glass.
