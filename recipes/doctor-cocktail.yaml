      notes:
        - text: Kronan Swedish Punsch and Smith & Cross (or Myers) rum
        - text: .5oz lime juice also suggested
        - text: this may benefit from not-S&C rum, as there is a huge amount of unnecessary hogo
        - text: with Xaymuca it comes out ok, not super exicting but definitely less funk than s&c
