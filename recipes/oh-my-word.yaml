            This works quite nicely. Did two variants with Barr Hill Tomcat / Maraska
            and Ransom/Luxardo. They came out different with the former being a bit
            sweeter and less aromatic. The other was more aromatic and a touch dryer but
            also less rich. Either would be fine but I think the ligher one works better.
