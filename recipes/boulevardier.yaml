          Combine the bourbon, Cambari, and sweet vermouth in a mixing glass filled
          with ice. Stir until chilled and strain into a double old-fashioned flass
          over a large ice cube or into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass. Garnish
          with the orange zest.

            Turns out this works out better than I expected. A phat twist with
            French sweet vermouth certainly helps.
