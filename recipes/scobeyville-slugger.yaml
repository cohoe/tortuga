            Served in a chilled flask in a book alongside the glass and ice.
            Encyclopedia Brown is a rotating stirred drink on the menu.

            Made as-spec'd. This was not good. I had this before at SG and it was
            great so I'm not sure what I'm doing differently. Maybe overdiluted?
            It's rather watery. Maybe that's the issue? Flavor profile still not
            stellar. Feels like its missing something.

            Tommy said there is a sugar component here. Track torwards an old
            fashioned rather than manhattan. Uses a gomme or other thickening
            agent instead. Perhaps a rich cane/demerara?

            0.5oz of 2:1 demerara syrup definitely brings out the apple but is
            far too sweet. Need to cut it down a bit to maybe 0.25oz instead.
            But we definitely have something here.
