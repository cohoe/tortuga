            Yeah this is still good. Could be interesting to do a double-Negroni spec
            rather than the semi-equal. Has the fruity aperol bitter bite but is
            balanced nicely by the pineapple and the punsch. A full spritz of orange
            seems fine too.

            Tried a spec of 2:1:.75. Is very fruit/ctirus forward. Almost too much. Might
            need to cut the pineapple with a normal rum. Not totally bad though. As with
            many of my others I need to work on my chilling. Colder better. Also did with
            an orange twist. Also finally looked up what Aleppo is, other than a city in
            Syria its a pepper. Picture has the garnish on the rim so its likely more aromatic
            than flavor. In doing some digging it seems that Pass & Provisions closed in
            mid-2019. Very sad, was looking forward to having on there some day.
