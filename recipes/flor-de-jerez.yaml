    story: >-
      Oh, sherry. Sometime around 2009 every one of our bartenders fell hard
      for this fortified wine because of how its flavors and acidity mingle
      so well with other cocktail ingredients. (We also loved that it's a
      cheap-as-hell base ingredient--you can buy a great bottle for under
      $12.) Joaquín was particularly smitten with the amontillado style of
      sherry, which is dry but smells sweat, leaving room for the bartender
      to add other sweeteners to a drink. In his Flor de Jerez, Joaquín uses
      rum to bring out the sherry's darker, raisiny flavors, and apricot
      liqueur to bring out its fruity notes.
