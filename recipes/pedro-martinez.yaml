            and add the remaining liquid ingredients. Stir the ingredients with 
            ice to chill, then strain into a glass holding a single large ice cube.

            pay careful attention to the drops vs dashes. mine was far too ango-heavy which
            is easy to do when you mix drops and dashes. the lime peel doesn't seem to do
            much.

            Having fixed my issue above, this is a good stirred rum drink. I dont think its
            as good as the Rail Stop martinez but very few things are. Did with 1.5oz El
            Dorado 12 and a half oz of Privateer to give it some kick. One dash Ango.
            No sugar is cool and the house sweet vermouth works out pretty good. Dolin would
            make this a bit too sweet I think.
