            All ingredients as spec'd. I think its a bit too orange-y. Between the Cointreau,
            orange bitters, and orange garnish. I also get a weird sensation that reminds me
            of sunscreen spray which I find quite unsettling. Maybe my orange peel or Carpano
            have gone wonk? Something about this is sharp and not in a good way.
