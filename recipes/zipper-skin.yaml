      Zipper Skins are a variety of Dancy tangerine whose skins are easily peeled
      or zipped off. This drink is plentiful with orange flavors: China China is
      an orange and herb amaro that has notes of charred orange marmalde. Southern
      Amaro is made by High Wire Distilling in Charleston SC. Made from gentian,
      mint, black tea and Daney tangerines, it's rich and flavorful and brings this
      while concoction together in Southern style. Though it's a sipper, it zips
      down fast.

            Canonical Amor would be to use Evan Williams Single Barrel for the
            bourbon. While the book claims discarded garnish, photo evidence
            suggests this is no longer the practice. I have not had the
            Southern amaro yet so everything I have is guestimation.
