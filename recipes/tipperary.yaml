            I like the lack of heavy chartreusing going on here. Comes off a
            bit light with just the whiskey and vermouth (did with Dead Rabbit).
            The orange twist and perhaps a touch more than a rinse may do this
            better. Alternatively a less refined irish whiskey. Upon further
            experimentation, no the quality going in has a bearing on the quality
            coming out. Writers Tears was "ok" but I was not particuarly thrilled.
            Nor was I with some house sweet vermouth. The Dolin adds a required
            sweetness here. I'm curious how the proper Black Bush would do. My
            mix of 50% of each Dead Rabbit / Writers Tears and Dolin / House Sweet
            is actually rather enjoyable. The rinse of Chatreuse is still plenty
            appropriate and any more would lead to a Brother Cleve-esque spec. I
            still think it could use a twist. Oh fuck it... NO. The orange twist
            totally screws with this and overpowers the drink. Would not recommend.
            Becomes too citrusy. Again it's not "bad" but I'd rather not have it
            given the choice. Wonder if OG Bushmills would do better. I'm afraid my
            proper evaluation criteria are somewhat impaired at the moment but
            what the hell why not. OG Bushmills is far to bland. Doesn't stand
            up for itself and not overly flavorful. The original spec I did with
            Dead Rabbit was better than this. I think I enjoyed the blend as
            mentioned above, which could give credence to the Black Bush as the
            spec originally calls for. It's the 1-year anniversary of my trip to
            Ireland where I passed through the town of Bushmills and did not have
            an opportunity to stop and get a proper rundown of their marks. The
            Black Bush is apparently high-malt which I'm not sure any of my
            stock can properly mimick.
