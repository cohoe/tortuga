            This is rather delightful. Has a touch of the minty/menthol on
            the end and enough complexity to keep you interested. Did with
            Lairds Bonded Apple brandy and Dolin Blanc Vermouth. Plus being
            a scaffa it's super easy to build. A very nice end of the evening
            drink.
