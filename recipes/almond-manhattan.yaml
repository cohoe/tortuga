            Did with Rittenhouse 100 Rye, others as specd. Came out cloudy which is not how I remember
            but looking back at pictures sorta makes sense. Is a little on the sweet side. Might be due
            to a full barspoon of cherry syrup I put in. The quarter oz of orgeat may be worth reducing
            to avoid overpowering. Flavor-wise not bad. Need a strong rye to stand up to everything
            that is going on here.
