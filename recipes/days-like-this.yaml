      This drink plays off the highlighted barrel and toasted sugar notes in Bacardi 8, placing them at the fore and letting sherry and floral vermouth elevate those flavors instead of competing with them. Itâ€™s an easy year-round drink that can be appreciated by the pros while also serving as a great introduction to rum cocktails.

            Balanced but on the drier side. not my favorite but easily poundable.
