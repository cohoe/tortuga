      The Delores Royale, a clear wink at the seasonal change from summer
      to fall, adds weight to its smoky mezcal base by way of apricot
      liqueur and amontillado sherryâ€”then is brightened by citrus (in the
      form of mandarin vodka and lime) and topped with sparkling wine, in
      a refreshing nod to late summer spritzes.
