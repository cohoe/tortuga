      At Lost Hours, the new Koreatown bar from the team behind Death & Co,
      the cocktail menu is structured around the four elements of nature:
      Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. From the Earth section, the Pennington
      Daiquiri zeros in on "green" flavors. "The grassiness of rhum agricole
      balanced by the herbaceous flavor of Suze helps create a complex but
      easy-drinking Daiquiri-inspired cocktail," says beverage director
      Tyson Buhler.
