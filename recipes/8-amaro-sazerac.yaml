            The 8 amaro blend changes over time. I use a set based on a decent
            IG post. All blends are equal parts.
            Aperol, Cynar, Dell'erborist, Vecchio, Montenegro, Averna, Ramazzotti, China-China
            A post from the bar in 2021 yields the following instead.
            Aperol, Cynar, Dell'erborist, Vecchio, Montenegro, Averna, Ramazzotti, Amer Nouvelle
            I call that close enough.

            Did with a big rock once. Worked great, went down a little too fast.
            Rock didn't hurt but I think could take away from the sipping.
            This drink is excellent.
