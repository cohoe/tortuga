      This cocktail was my first epiphany about using mezcal in a mixed
      drink. Doing so is common now, but nobody was mixing with it back then.

            Very grassy, somewhat funky. On paper this should be very spirit
            forward and not balanced but this isn't that at all. Flavor-forward
            sure but it actually comes out rather nicely. Definitely best when
            absolutely rocket cold.
