            Oh yeah, I dig this. Better if I gave it the full chilling it deserves.
            Lemon twist is clutch. Could probably get away with grapefruit but
            absolutely not orange. Need some the drying effect. I feel like this
            isn't overly sweet either. Did with the normal Vida though since
            apparently Del Maguey has a new one thats going to confuse everyone.
