            While this Cuban classic is right at home in Kyshali Ramirez's
            home state of Florida, itâ€™s also straightforward enough to make
            at your home bar. Apothecary 330's version calls for equal parts
            aged rum and bianco vermouth, lifted by housemade grenadine.

            Homemade grenadine, 8oz POM pomegranate juice, 4oz sugar, 5-6 drops
            orange blossom water. Add pomegranate juice to a saucepan over medium
            heat and bring to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half, about 4 ounces.
            Add sugar and stir until completely dissolved. Remove from heat and
            add 5 to 6 drops of orange blossom water. Bottle and refrigerate.
        - text: even with not-grenadine this is good. real grenadine probably makes it better
