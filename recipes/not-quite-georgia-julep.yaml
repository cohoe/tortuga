            Put all the ingredients in a julep tin. Fill the tin halfway with crushed ice.
            Stir with a teaspoon, churning the ice as you go, for about 10 seconds, holding
            the tin by rim so the entire tin can eventually frost up. Add more crushed ice
            to fill the tin two-thirds full and stir until the tin is completely frosted.
            Add more ice to form a cone above the rum.
      garnish:
        - slug: mint

            The ice does have a positive impact on this! this would be better on a nice
            hot summer day, perhaps pitcherable for porchfest or something like that if
            were ever allowed outside again
