    - name: original
      glassware: julep
      components:
        - name: cognac
          quantity: 1
          unit: oz

        - name: simple syrup
          quantity: 1
          unit: tsp
      construction: stir
      instructions:
        - put all the ingredients in a julep tin
        - fill the tin halfway with crushed ice
        - stir with a teaspoon, churning the ice as you go, for about 10 seconds, holding the tin by rim so the entire tin can eventually frost up
        - add more crushed ice to fill the tin two-thirds full and stir until the tin is completely frosted
        - add more ice to form a cone above the rum
      garnish:
        - mint bouquet (in the center of the ice)
      straw: true
      notes:
        - the ice does have a positive impact on this
        - this would be better on a nice hot summer day, perhaps pitcherable for porchfest or something like that if were ever allowed outside again
