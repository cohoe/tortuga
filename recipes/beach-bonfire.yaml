            Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into an Old-Fashioned
            glass over 1 large ice cube. Using a PolyScience Smoking Gun or something
            similar, shoot some hickory smoke over the drink to create just a
            whisper of smoke aroma. Garnish with the dehydrated pineapple and serve
            with the glass of beer alongside.

            This would be way better with the smoke and garnish. Spec'd ingredients alone
            are OK but not overly exciting. An interesting blend of bourbon/cachaca.
