            Build? That seems a bit weird. Stir works just fine. Delightful with Appleton 12,
            but maybe a bit too sweet. Also forgot bitters. The build might actually work too
            since it gets pretty watery.
            Second attempt included the bitters. I think a single dash would work better. Also
            didn't do the generous .25oz of the first attempt and I think it messed with the
            spec.
