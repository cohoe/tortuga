      A mix of two ounces of Cognac, with touches of yellow Chartreuse and
      Cynar, and two types of bitters, Nicole Lebedevitch’s Ce Soir is simple,
      potent and elegant—and, according to Robert Simonson, who chose it as
      one of his top cocktails of 2017, it deserves to be better-known.

            Did with all original ingredients. Has a chocolatey taste to it
            which is interesting. Might have done too much ango. Regardless
            the high proof cognac seems to work well here.
