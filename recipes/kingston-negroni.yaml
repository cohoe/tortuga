            Way more root forward than I hoped, slightly dilluted it gets better.
            Definitly unique and interesting.

            Did with a 1:1 blend of dolin:cocchi-torino. This is really nice. An initial hit of
            fruitiness that evolves to a slightly bitter drying finish. This could be a good
            way to ween onto Campari. Wonder how the Zucca would do here? Compared to the Sother
            Teague Improved spec which comes out a bit root-y this might be able to balance it
            out. Nope, I consider that definitely inferior. Lacks any of the bitter bite
            that gives it a good length. Not bad but definitely stick with the spec.

            House Sweet did not go as well as I thought. Was fine but it felt lacking. Need
            to get a bottle of cinzano to compare to.

            Now that I have a Cinzano, oh yeah its definitely in the Dolin category. Need
            the full sweetness aspect there. Definitely rounds this out nicely. A slightly
            bitter bite to it but not overly so. A most excellent drink.
