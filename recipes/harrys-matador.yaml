      This version of the classic Matador cocktail drinks like a tequila Manhattan,
      with the rich, almost chocolatey notes of reposado tequila taking center stage.
      Choose a good reposado or aÃ±ejo tequila, Ivan Mitankin advises: "You need a
      wood-aged tequila for the cocktail to come alive. With a blanco, it just loses it."

            Combine first four ingredients in a mixing glass over ice. Twist a grapefruit
            peel over the top of the glass to express the essential oils, then discard.
            Strain into a Nick & Nora glass. Garnish with dehydrated lemon wheel.

            I did with an average reposado (Cazadores) and was out of Dolin (Carpano).
            Definitely missed something there. For the Manhattan style this would work
            really well with a bit higher class. Will definitely give it a go.

            This differs from a regular Matador which is way more citrusy.
