            This has a really interesting chocolate-esque note, and its
            more than just the bitters. I suspect its a mix of the Zacapa
            and the bitters, maybe with some of that mid-range Appleton.
            I really like it. For an old fashioned its a lot of work but
            comes out really good. Did about 1/8oz of 2:1 demerara syrup
            since getting out a teaspoon sucks. As with other drinks the
            S&C can be a bit of a bully but here it is tamed quite nicely
            to amp up the proof and provide a backbone but not overpower
            with its funk.
