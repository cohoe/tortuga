            All of these were each with the Avua Prata and Amburana. First was the PDT spec.
            Not enough sugar. Second was the Fogo spec with a tbsp sugar. Way too sweet.
            Need to find something in the middle. A little Sprite made this more drinkable.

            Did with 1/4oz lime and 1/4oz 2:1 demerara. Came out ok but not stellar.
            Wonder if that's the raw Leblon talking. At Fogo I've been getting the
            Novo gold. Maybe not enough lime?

            Prepare the lime by slicing off the ends and cutting it in half down the spine.
            Remove the spine from each side by slicing in a V shape then quarter the pieces
            and place into a mixing glass. Muddle the lime with the simple syrup then add
            the Cachaça and ice. Stir to combine then pour unstrained into a double old-fashioned
            glass.

            Lime management is key. This video taught me how to pick good limes. They should
            be smooth, slightly shiny, and soft. Hard and rough texture no bueno.

            This is the best home-grown caipirinha I've ever made. The problem with grain
            sugar is that you get the sandy beach at the bottom of the glass. PDT doesn't
            do enough lime. I'm sure an aged cachaça would do ok but to be honest this is
            plenty good enough.
