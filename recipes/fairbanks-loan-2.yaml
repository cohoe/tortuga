      This loose interpretation of the Douglas Fairbanks, a Prohibition-era
      cocktail poured at Sloppy Joe’s in Havana, is "reminiscent of a
      Daiquiri on steroids," says Brian Kane. Originally made with gin,
      apricot brandy and egg white, the drink is named after the influential
      silent film actor who became one of Hollywood’s earliest megastars.
