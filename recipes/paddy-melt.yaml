            Old Overholt and a dash or two of Bittermens Boston Bittahs make this work nicely.
            Turns out 18.21 or Bittermens makes a dedicated chamomile bitters so I'm now fighting
            the urge to buy that and see how this goes. Since I never had a reference I don't know
            how intense to make it. Regardless this is quite a nice drink, plus the story is fun.
