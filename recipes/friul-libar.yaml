            Combine all of the ingredients except the garnish in a cocktail shaker
            filled with ice. Shake until chilled and double-strain into a chilled
            coupe or cocktail glass. Express the lemon peel over the surface of the
            drink, then, per Elliott, "garnish sexily" by putting a notch in the peel
            and affixing it to the glass. "I hate things floating around in my drink",
            he explains.

            Did with Bluecoat 47% gin. I dig this. Interesting play between the
            lemon and nonino. Its a sour with a bit more complexities. The super
            hot gin would likely give this an extra kick.
