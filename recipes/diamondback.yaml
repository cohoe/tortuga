      notes:
        - text: tastes like just the rye, barely any hint of the other ingredients
        - text: from a night at Drink, try equal parts
        - text: equal parts does yield a less rye-forward drink, though had to do with calvados since im out of apple brandy
        - text: almost a bit too chart-y so maybe reduce that a bit? but its still good enough

      notes:
        - text: spin on the Diamondback from a night years ago, equalizing the ratios and subbing tequila for apple brandy
        - text: not as good as the original, has a bit too much spice and chartreuse, the reposado doesnt really come forward enough
