            Did with the Black Button citrus gin. I do not like this. Too much weird
            shit going on. Especually when compared to the others. Improves over time
            but I still would prefer a version with a proper london dry rather than the
            weird stuff.

            Another attempt with Plymouth, Dolin, and a Lemon Twist. Still works out
            great! Less remeniscient of a Martinez though, not sure where I was at with
            that.

            Oh yes. Did with Citadelle, Dolin, and an Orange Twist. This is an excellent
            lighter-ish version of a martinez, which I find surprising. Could benefit from
            more chilling. The bene adds a nice herbal note without being overpowering.
