      Based on a shot of the same name (equal parts mezcal, green and yellow chartreuse),
      I added a little dry(sic) vermouth and altered the equal parts original to be a longer and
      more sophisticated cocktail that is simultaneously sweet and smokey. It'll have you
      putting on your boogie shoes, while still leaving you in prime dancing shape.

            Did with Casamigos, Dolin, and Boston Bittahs. I had doubts going into this
            but it really works. Carpano might bring down the sweetness a touch. A fully
            chilled glass would also make a difference. I dig it. Touch of smoke touch of
            herbal but not overly in-your-face.
