      One can only speculate about the reasoning behind the authorâ€™s choice
      of "Honeymoon" as the title of this knee-bendingly boozy sour.

            This was quite nice. Good for a fall drink. Calvados may be too
            heavy compared to the lairds but I'm out.

            Made this again with the appropriate Lairds. A little too dry.
            Wonder if cointreau or some other non-super-dry orange curacao
            would do better. While interesting in apple/lemon blend I'm not
            convinced I actually like this one again.
