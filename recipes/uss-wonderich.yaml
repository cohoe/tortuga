    story: >-
      Jeff Beachbum Berry conceived of this recipe as an 
      "intermission drink"-a light refresher intended to be consumed in
      between full-strength cocktails. The name pays tribute to David
      Wondrich, a proponent of this practice, and incidentally, the
      first guest to request a sherry drink at Berry's famed New Orleans
      tiki bar, Latitude 29.
