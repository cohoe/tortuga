      I was so impressed (and jealous) when Brian created his Conference
      cocktail that I had to rip it off. My version replaced the whiskey with
      tequila, naturally.

            With Casamigos Mezcal and Reposado Tequila (realizing that only in writing this)
            this comes out just fine. Not too overpowering and has a weird chocolately sense.
            Kinda worried the butterscotchness of the Casamigos Repo is doing something here.
            Again a light touch of mole goes a long way. If I have to pick between a Conference
            and this I'd rather have this.
