      Teatro, Spanish for theater, is a spin on the classic Bijou cocktail.
      Bijou, in addition to once being a popuar name for theaters and movie
      houses in the U.S, is also the French word for jewel, and its name is
      meant to represent the cocktail's main ingreidents: gin represents
      diamonds, Chartreuse represents emeralds and sweet vermouth represents
      rubies. Stirred together in equal parts and served up, it's quite a
      delicious concoction. When I was building a menu and looking to fill
      a slot with a tequila drink, I decided to play around with the Bijou
      recipe because I love the combination of tequila and herbal liqueurs.
      The sweet vermouth adds a richness and the bitters bring in a slight
      citrus note that binds everything together. Though it's an all spirit
      drink, the Teatro may feel too flabby on your palate, so feel free to
      shake this one so it's aerated and lighter in texture.

            I've been drinking but this works nicely. Pay attention to what you're
            doing so you don't end up with a double. Not that that's a bad thing.
            Not overly sweet, but not super dry either. Did with Astral blanco.
